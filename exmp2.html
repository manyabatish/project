      <h2>Recipes- World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h2>
        <p>I adopted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Granger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross.<br/>
		Sydney, I have beeen after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really beleive are the best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>The following ingredients make one serving:</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>2 eggs</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon of butter (10g)</li>
		<li>1/3 cup of cream (23/40 ounces)</li>
		<li>A pinch of salt</li>
		<li>Freshly miled black pepper</li>
		<li>3 fresh chives (chopped)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Whisk eggs, cream, and salt in a bowl.</li>
		<li>Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat (taking care not to burn the butter).</li>
		<li>Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting around the edge of the pan (around 20 seconds).</li>
		<li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
		<li>Fold contents in again, leave 20 seconds, and repeat until the eggs are only just done.</li>
		<li>Grind a light sprinkling of freshly miled pepper over the eggs and blend in some chopped fresh chives.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>You should only make a <b>maximum</b> of two servings per frying pan.</p>
